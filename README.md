# GSoC18-Demo
Demo Repo for GSoC18 Final Evaluation

This repo contains the test scripts used in the asciicasts for the final GSoC 2018 [report](https://kaivalyar.github.io/gsoc18-pracmln/posts/final-gsoc-report/) on PracMLN.

The content here is adapted from the test scripts in the [PracTests](https://github.com/kaivalyar/PracTests) repository. Care has been taken to ensure that each subdirectory functions independently.

# Details

1. **Complete**: A complete test of all _learning_ and _inference_ algorithms currently implemented in PracMLN. Uses a tiny version of the _smokers_ MLN.
2. **EnumerationAsk**: A larger test, but of only the _EnumerationAsk_ inference algorithm. Used to measure progress over the course of the GSoC project.
3. **requirements.txt**: Helper file to direct `pip` to install all dependencies to run the demo scripts.
